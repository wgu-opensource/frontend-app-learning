/**
 * This hook will find the index of the last child of a containing element
 * that fits within its bounding rectangle. This is done by summing the widths
 * of the children until they exceed the width of the container.
 *
 * The hook returns an array containing:
 * [indexOfLastVisibleChild, containerElementRef, invisibleStyle, overflowElementRef]
 *
 * indexOfLastVisibleChild - the index of the last visible child
 * containerElementRef - a ref to be added to the containing html node
 * invisibleStyle - a set of styles to be applied to child of the containing node
 *    if it needs to be hidden. These styles remove the element visually, from
 *    screen readers, and from normal layout flow. But, importantly, these styles
 *    preserve the width of the element, so that future width calculations will
 *    still be accurate.
 * overflowElementRef - a ref to be added to an html node inside the container
 *    that is likely to be used to contain a "More" type dropdown or other
 *    mechanism to reveal hidden children. The width of this element is always
 *    included when determining which children will fit or not. Usage of this ref
 *    is optional.
